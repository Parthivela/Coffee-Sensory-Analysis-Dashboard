# Coffee-Sensory-Analysis-Dashboard
This project presents a Power BI dashboard that performs sensory evaluation analysis of coffee. The analysis focuses on key factors influencing coffee quality, such as aroma, flavor, body, acidity, and aftertaste. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization of coffee sensory data to identify patterns and insights. The final dashboard offers an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore and understand coffee quality evaluations based on sensory ratings
